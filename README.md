SQL and Python-based analysis of protein expression and treatment outcomes in breast cancer patients.
# Protein Expression and Treatment Outcomes in Breast Cancer

This project examines the relationship between protein expression patterns, diagnostic features, and treatment outcomes in patients with breast cancer. It uses a structured SQL database and data analysis in Python to identify potential biomarkers and evaluate clinical interventions.

---

## 🧬 Project Overview

### Goals:
- Analyze protein expression levels and their correlation with survival outcomes.
- Explore how tumor stage and surgery types affect treatment success.
- Leverage SQL and Python for clinical data analysis and visualization.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **MySQL**, **phpMyAdmin** — database design and management
- **Jupyter Notebook** — analysis and visualization
- **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** — data handling and plotting
- **SQL** — complex queries and joins on normalized tables

---

## 🧱 Database Design

The database was normalized to 3NF and included entities:
- `Patient`
- `Diagnosis`
- `Protein_Expression`
- `Surgery`
- `Surgery_Type`

Key features:
- Primary/foreign key constraints
- Indexes for optimization
- Efficient joins for scalable queries

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed

- **Tumor Stage vs. Survival Outcomes**
- **Protein Expression Levels vs. Patient Status**
- **Surgery Types vs. Survival Rates**
- Optimized queries using indexing and join refinement
